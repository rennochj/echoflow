# Next Phase Transition

You are managing the transition from the current phase to the next phase in the development plan.

## Your Task
1. **Validate current phase completion** against all acceptance criteria
2. **Generate phase completion report** summarizing what was accomplished
3. **Check prerequisites** for the next phase
4. **Prepare next phase briefing** with scope and objectives
5. **Request explicit approval** before proceeding
6. **STOP and WAIT** for human confirmation

**‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPING POINT**
I will wait for your explicit approval before starting any Phase [N+1] work.

## Instructions
1. Read the build plan to understand current and next phases
2. Thoroughly validate current phase completion
3. Prepare comprehensive transition briefing
4. Request specific approvals
5. DO NOT start next phase work without explicit confirmation
6. If any validation fails, report issues and recommendations
