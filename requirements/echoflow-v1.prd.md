## 🎯 What are we building?

A platform for managing and orchestrating event-driven workflows.

## 🤔 Why are we building it?

I need an easy to use and deploy platform for converting documents in various formats into markdown formats and related aretifacts.

## 👤 Who is this for?

I want to use this to integrate with coding assistance tools and other generative AI applications that rely on text-based content.

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Feature 1** - Receive documents in various formats, including:
  - PDF
  - DOCX
  - PPTX
  - TXT
  - HTML
  - Markdown

2. **Feature 2** - Process individual documents or multiple documents in a specified directory. 

3. **Feature 3** - Extract content from each of the documents including:
    - Text
    - Images
    - Metadata
    - URL / Hyperlinks

4. **Feature 4** - Return documents in a zip format or write them to specified output directories.

5. **Feature 5** - Expose this application as an MCP server capable of integration with claude code and github copilot.

6. **Feature 6** - Run this application as a docker container

## 📏 Success Metrics

- **Document conversion coverage**: 100% for all 6 supported formats
- **Performance**: <30s for 50MB files, <5min for 100 documents  
- **Reliability**: >99% successful conversion rate
- **API Response Time**: <2s for typical documents
- **Memory efficiency**: <1GB RAM for standard operations
- **Easy to use as an API**: Structured MCP protocol with clear schemas
- **Easy to deploy**: Single Docker command deployment

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Libraries
- **Primary Engine**: Docling (IBM's AI-powered document processing)
  - Advanced PDF understanding with layout analysis
  - Native support for all required formats
  - Built-in metadata and image extraction
  - Optimized for AI/ML workflows

- **Fallback Libraries**: 
  - pdfplumber for complex PDF table extraction
  - python-docx for advanced DOCX manipulation
  - pypandoc as format conversion fallback

### Infrastructure
- **MCP Framework**: FastMCP for protocol handling
- **Container**: Docker with Chainguard Python base image
- **Package Manager**: UV for Python dependency management
- **Python Version**: 3.9+ with async/await support

## 📋 Technical Requirements

### Performance & Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Progress reporting for batch operations
- Graceful degradation for unsupported content
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files

### Integration & API
- Structured input/output schemas for all MCP tools
- Claude Code MCP integration testing
- GitHub Copilot compatibility validation
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Real-time conversion status updates

### Quality & Security
- 80% minimum test coverage with pytest
- Security scanning and vulnerability management
- Type hints throughout codebase
- Code quality gates (ruff, black, mypy)
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### Deployment & Operations
- Docker deployment with health checks
- Environment-based configuration
- Container resource limits and monitoring
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Production logging and alerting

### Build Automation
- Makefile for task automation (e.g. test execution, linting, etc.)
- Docker Compose for multi-container setups
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

### Documentation Structure & Standards
- **README.md**: Public-facing project documentation for end users
  - Project overview and core features
  - Quick start guide and installation instructions
  - Basic usage examples and API documentation links
  - License and contribution information
  - Reference to DEVELOPMENT.md for developers
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Internal developer workflow and contribution guide (separate from README.md)
  - Comprehensive development workflows and coding standards
  - Quality gate procedures and testing strategies
  - Detailed debugging and profiling guides
  - Phase-specific development guidelines
  - Advanced tooling and environment setup
- **CLAUDE.md**: AI assistant behavioral guidelines and code standards
- **Separation Rationale**: Keep documentation focused - README.md serves users while DEVELOPMENT.md serves developers, following standard open source practices

## 🚫 What we're NOT building

- Real-time collaborative editing features
- Document version control or history
- User authentication or authorization systems
- Document storage or database persistence
- Web-based user interface or dashboard
