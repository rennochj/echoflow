## 🎯 What are we building?

A platform for managing and orchestrating event-driven workflows.

## 🤔 Why are we building it?

I need an easy to use and deploy platform for converting documents in various formats into markdown formats and related aretifacts.

## 👤 Who is this for?

I want to use this to integrate with coding assistance tools and other generative AI applications that rely on text-based content.

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Feature 1** - Receive documents in various formats, including:
  - PDF
  - DOCX
  - PPTX
  - TXT
  - HTML
  - Markdown

2. **Feature 2** - Process individual documents or multiple documents in a specified directory. 

3. **Feature 3** - Extract content from each of the documents including:
    - Text
    - Images
    - Metadata
    - URL / Hyperlinks

4. **Feature 4** - Return documents in a zip format or write them to specified output directories.

5. **Feature 5** - Expose this application as an MCP server capable of integration with claude code and github copilot.

6. **Feature 6** - Run this application as a docker container

## 📏 Success Metrics

- **Document conversion coverage**: 100% for all 6 supported formats
- **Performance**: <30s for 50MB files, <5min for 100 documents  
- **Reliability**: >99% successful conversion rate
- **API Response Time**: <2s for typical documents
- **Memory efficiency**: <1GB RAM for standard operations
- **Easy to use as an API**: Structured MCP protocol with clear schemas
- **Easy to deploy**: Single Docker command deployment

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Libraries
- **Primary Engine**: Docling (IBM's AI-powered document processing)
  - Advanced PDF understanding with layout analysis
  - Native support for all required formats
  - Built-in metadata and image extraction
  - Optimized for AI/ML workflows

- **Fallback Libraries**: 
  - pdfplumber for complex PDF table extraction
  - python-docx for advanced DOCX manipulation
  - pypandoc as format conversion fallback

### Infrastructure
